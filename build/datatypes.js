console.table([typeof(undefined) , typeof(null) ])
// the main diff bet this two console are that typeof will ony show the type oof the vaibles which comes first.
// the types of null and underfined is object and undefined .
// undeinfed has been showing it's type has undefined because we have declatred an varible but not assigned any value to it .
// null type is object but its not actual object.  It is a way of expressing that there is no meaningful data to assign to the variable or property.
